        <h2>0.1 - Using This Document</h2>
        <p>While creating this document, I took every effort to try to make it easy to read, as well as easy to find what you're looking for.</p>
        <p>In most cases, where a hexadecimal value is given, it is followed by the equivalent decimal value in parenthesis. For example, "<code>0x200 (512)</code>".</p>
        <p>In most cases, when a word or letter is italicized, it is referring to a variable value, for example, if I write "<code>Vx</code>", the <code>x</code> refers to a 4-bit value.</p>
        <p>The most important thing to remember as you read this document is that every [TOC] link will take you back to the Table Of Contents. Also, links that you have not yet visited will appear in blue, while links you have used will be gray.</p>

        <h2>1.0 - About Chip-8</h2>
        <p>Whenever I mention to someone that I'm writing a Chip-8 interpreter, the response is always the same: "What's a Chip-8?"</p>
        <p>Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990s, the Chip-8 language was revived by a man named Andreas Gustafsson. He created a Chip-8 interpreter for the HP48 graphing calculator, called Chip-48. The HP48 was lacking a way to easily make fast games at the time, and Chip-8 was the answer. Chip-48 later begat Super Chip-48, a modification of Chip-48 which allowed higher resolution graphics, as well as other graphical enhancements.</p>
        <p>Chip-48 inspired a whole new crop of Chip-8 interpreters for various platforms, including MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Amiga, HP48, MSX, Adam, and ColecoVision. I became involved with Chip-8 after stumbling upon Paul Robson's interpreter on the World Wide Web. Shortly after that, I began writing my own Chip-8 interpreter.</p>
        <p>This document is a compilation of all the different sources of information I used while programming my interpreter.</p>

        <h2>2.0 - Chip-8 Specifications</h2>
        <p>This section describes the Chip-8 memory, registers, display, keyboard, and timers.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 - Memory</h3>
        <p>The Chip-8 language is capable of accessing up to 4KB (4,096 bytes) of RAM, from location <code>0x000 (0)</code> to <code>0xFFF (4095)</code>. The first 512 bytes, from <code>0x000</code> to <code>0x1FF</code>, are where the original interpreter was located, and should not be used by programs.</p>
        <p>Most Chip-8 programs start at location <code>0x200 (512)</code>, but some begin at <code>0x600 (1536)</code>. Programs beginning at <code>0x600</code> are intended for the ETI 660 computer.</p>

        <h3>2.2 - Registers</h3>
        <p>Chip-8 has 16 general purpose 8-bit registers, usually referred to as <code>Vx</code>, where <code>x</code> is a hexadecimal digit (0 through F). There is also a 16-bit register called <code>I</code>. This register is generally used to store memory addresses, so only the lowest (rightmost) 12 bits are usually used.</p>
        <p>The <code>VF</code> register should not be used by any program, as it is used as a flag by some instructions. See section 3.0, Instructions for details.</p>
        <p>Chip-8 also has two special purpose 8-bit registers, for the delay and sound timers. When these registers are non-zero, they are automatically decremented at a rate of 60Hz. See the section 2.5, Timers & Sound, for more information on these.</p>
        <p>There are also some "pseudo-registers" which are not accessible from Chip-8 programs. The program counter (<code>PC</code>) should be 16-bit, and is used to store the currently executing address. The stack pointer (<code>SP</code>) can be 8-bit, it is used to point to the topmost level of the stack.</p>
        <p>The stack is an array of 16 16-bit values, used to store the address that the interpreter should return to when finished with a subroutine. Chip-8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 - Keyboard</h3>
        <p>Chip-8 has a hexadecimal keypad which consists of 16 keys. The keys are mapped to hexadecimal digits 0 through F. The key states are polled by the Chip-8 interpreter.</p>
        <div class="diagram">
            <p>Keypad Layout:</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>2.4 - Display</h3>
        <p>Chip-8 has a display with a resolution of 64x32 pixels. The display is a grid of 64 columns by 32 rows. Each pixel is represented by a single bit. The display is updated by the Chip-8 interpreter during each cycle, drawing or erasing pixels according to the current instructions.</p>
        <div class="diagram">
            <p>Display Grid:</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>2.5 - Timers & Sound</h3>
        <p>The Chip-8 has two timers, the delay timer and the sound timer. These timers are decremented at a rate of 60Hz. When a timer reaches zero, it stops decrementing. The delay timer controls the speed of certain operations, while the sound timer is used to create sound effects.</p>
        <p>The delay timer and sound timer are both 8-bit registers.</p>

        <h2>3.0 - Chip-8 Instructions</h2>

        <h3>3.1 - Instruction Format</h3>
